{"name":"Sample-sass","tagline":"Example of My Current Sass Approach","body":"I have been reading about and working with Sass locally for quite a while and I recently started implementing it in a couple of production sites. \r\n\r\nI am loving Sass so far and it's brought me a new perspective and renewed interest and enjoyment in working with CSS. No doubt my approach will continue to evolve, but even at this early stage I am pretty sold on the value of Sass and already feel a sense of restriction when working with vanilla CSS.\r\n\r\nI've been using Grunt to compile and I've included a basic Sass compiling build setup.\r\n\r\n[See This Sass in Action](http://amd.lamvin.com/) (site still in development).  \r\n[Another Sass Site in Progress](http://joesaad.com/) (uses the same basic Sass setup)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
