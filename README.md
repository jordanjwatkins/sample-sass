#Sample Sass

**Example of My Current Sass Approach**

I have been reading about and working with Sass locally for quite a while and I recently started implementing it in a couple of production sites. 

I am loving Sass so far and it's brought me a new perspective and renewed interest and enjoyment in working with CSS. No doubt my approach will continue to evolve, but even at this early stage I am pretty sold on the value of Sass and already feel a sense of restriction when working with vanilla CSS.

I've been using Grunt to compile and I've included a basic Sass compiling build setup.
